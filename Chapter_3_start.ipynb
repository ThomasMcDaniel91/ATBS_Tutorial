        "Functions are an efficient way to use the same code repeatedly in a program without having to repeat the entire code. After you create a function, you only need to call it again to utilize all the underlying code in the function. You can also have functions in a seperate file and import them to keep your main file cleaner without the setup for functions cluttering up the top of the file.\n",
